# User Authentication Service - Learning Project

## Overview

Welcome to the User Authentication Service learning project implemented in Python, with bcrypt for secure password hashing. This project is designed to help you understand the basics of user authentication and password security.

## Features

- **User Registration:** Learn how users can register by providing a unique username and a secure password.

- **Password Hashing:** Explore the bcrypt hashing algorithm to securely hash and store user passwords, enhancing your understanding of password security best practices.

- **User Login:** Understand how to authenticate users by verifying their credentials against the stored hashed password.

## Dependencies

- **Python:** The project is implemented in Python, making it beginner-friendly and suitable for learning.

- **bcrypt:** Explore the bcrypt library for secure password hashing. Install it using `pip install bcrypt`.

## Getting Started

We assume you have python, flask and bcrypt installed

## Learning Points

- **Code Structure:** Explore the project's code to understand how different components work together.

- **Endpoints:** Study the registration and login endpoints to grasp the basics of user authentication.

- **Password Security:** Dive into the bcrypt implementation to understand how it enhances password security.

## Next Steps

Feel free to experiment, modify the code, and add new features to deepen your understanding of user authentication and Python development.
